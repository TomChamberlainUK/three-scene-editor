# Scene Editor

> Please note that this is a work in progress and is far from complete. The plan is to integrate this with my game engine framework, [ECS Engine](https://github.com/TomChamberlainUK/ecs-engine), as a means of inserting entities as well as adding, editing, or removing components.

A simple scene editor to edit a THREE.js scene in realtime.

## Demonstration

> This may suffer from performance issues on older systems.

A live version of this web application is available [here](https://tomchamberlainuk.github.io/three-scene-editor/).
